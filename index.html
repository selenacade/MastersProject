				<h1>Welcome to Selena's Master Project</h1>

				<p>For my master's project, I decided to focus on three main things: creating a website, using data analytics, and creating an accessible website. Throughout my undergraduate and graduate courses, I have always been interested in creating websites and learning more about accessibility. I have also taken many data analytics courses since my undergraduate track was Data Analytics. This website will use the skills I have learned not only in my courses but also what I have learned in my past internships. As I graduate in April and start a new job, I decided to take my data analytics skills to a new level using Power BI. I wanted to use the skills I learned in school and elevate them with the tools I will be using at my new job. This will allow me to explore the endless possibilities with Power BI.</p> 

                <p>Before visiting the next few pages of the website, I would like to explain the purpose of my project. I am a graduate assistant who supports youth in middle and high school at Grand Valley State University. Since the data I have gathered is confidential, I will be describing everything at a high level. The data presented is based on campus visits and retention.</p>
            
                <p>Please explore the next few pages to learn more about what I did for my project. If you have any questions, visit my contact page.</p>
