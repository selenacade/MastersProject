				<h1>Retention Data</h1>

					<h2>Overview of Data</h2>
					<p>Given the confidential nature of this data, all details will be kept anonymous. The dataset provided encompasses information on high schools, current enrollment statuses as of fall 2023 and winter 2024, majors, degrees pursued, and college start terms. As the number of students enrolling at Grand Valley increases, there's a growing necessity to gather data on their origins. While our campus visits cater to both middle and high school students, there's often a loss of data once they enter college. My aim is to improve the tracking and comprehension of student data. Before delving into the data, my primary objective was to establish a centralized platform where my team could access all relevant information seamlessly.</p>

					<h2>After Thoughts on Retention Data</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Given that this data isn't regularly reviewed, I recommend that my team establish a practice of reviewing it after each semester and school year. By comparing data from the current period with that of the previous semester or school year, we can ensure that we're maximizing our efforts to support students throughout their college journey. This approach will also aid the team in identifying students who may require more frequent contact than others.</li>
						<li>The data regarding students' degree and major was collected in February of this year, while information on college year and status was gathered in November of last year. Within this brief timeframe, there was a noticeable shift in the total number of students enrolled at Grand Valley. By conducting more frequent reviews of the data, the team will gain a clearer understanding of each student's situation and any changes that occur over time.</li>
